            Intermediate level Java programmer. I first started learning Java in 2019, as required for a high school class.
            Years later, I started to learn more Java, and on a more official basis; through high school and college.
            Java is my strongest programming language, so I'll be focusing on that for the greater part of my career.
            However, I absolutely love and adore side projects; one day I will be proficient enough to create my own programs.

            I really want to learn how to make graphical user interfaces, games, and build my own algorithms.
            Java will be the first language that I'll attempt those projects in.
            Another project I would like to do is create my own Java program that connects to the internet.
            Granted, that will take a lot of security measures and also require me to know how to connect to
            databases.
