            Intermediate level Java programmer. I first started learning Java in 2019, as required for a high school class.
            Years later, I started to learn more Java, and on a more official basis; through high school and college.
            Java is my strongest programming language, so I'll be focusing on that for the greater part of my career.
            However, I absolutely love and adore side projects; one day I will be proficient enough to create my own programs.

            I really want to learn how to make graphical user interfaces, games, and build my own algorithms.
            Java will be the first language that I'll attempt those projects in.
            Another project I would like to do is create my own Java program that connects to the internet.
            Granted, that will take a lot of security measures and also require me to know how to connect to
            databases.

            I am just beginning to learn x86-64 assembly.
            I'm learning how to program in assembly on Linux.
            It's significantly easier for me to learn on linux.
            Right now I'm learning system calls, how to use libraries, the stack and heap.
            My end goal is to make a piece of software using assembly.
            I have a few projects and some ideas I wish to implement.
            Assembly has been a fun and rewarding challenge for me so far, and I'd like to see how far I can go with it.

            I want to do the same things as I would do in Java: graphical user interface, game, algorithms.
            Some of the programming concepts I've learned easily fit into assembly (recursion), and others, not so easy (nodes).
            I'd like to try implementing a very simple form of object-oriented programming in assembly.
            Assembly wasn't originally built for object-oriented programing, so it's extremely difficult to implement it by hand.
            There aren't many references for Assembly online as well.

            I have beginner's experience with HTML, CSS, and Javascript.
            What makes these three easier to learn is that there's tons of documentation of them online.
            I started learning HTML back in 2017, which is quite a while ago.
            However, I did not have the mind I have now, that can understand it.
            I used to like building webpages from scratch, but that lead to issues with my coding.
            I had zero oversight from anyone, had no idea of at least some good practices, and just threw mud at the wall until it stuck.
            Looking back at my old work, I laugh now.
            Ever since learning more about web development in college, my work has been ten times as potent.

            I've worked with the Bootstrap library before. Granted, I'm still very new to it.
            I always feel iffy about using libraries.
            For some reason, I feel the urge to do ALL of the work by myself.
            I guess that's part of the reason why I'm learning Assembly.
            Going back to the topic of libraries, I'd like to learn and utilize common libraries.
            Doing that will increase my marketability as a developer.

            This website will continue to be updated for as long as I own this domain.
            Personal projects and progress will be updated here as I work on my own.
            The goal of this website is to be a portfolio that I and others can look back on, for reference, and for memories.
            I also find websites to be a beautiful medium to express myself with. It's easier for me to execute than artwork.
            Websites could be considered a form of art, maybe.
